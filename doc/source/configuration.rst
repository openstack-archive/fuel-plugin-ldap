   To add multiple domains such block of parameters should be added
   to 'List of additional Domains' text area and these blocks should
   be separated by empty line.

#. Continue with environment configuration and deploy it;
   for instructions, see
   `Mirantis OpenStack User Guide <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-8.0/pdf/Fuel-8.0-UserGuide.pdf>`_.

#. After successfull environment deployment log into dashboard in default domain:

   .. image:: images/default_domain.png

#. Go to Identity -> Domains, select needed domain and 'Set Domain Context' for the domain:

   .. image:: images/domains.png
   .. image:: images/domain_context.png

#. Go to Identity -> Projects and select 'Create Project' to create a new project for the domain
